# UAV-Agent Development Boundaries

This file records the project-level working agreement for future Codex work in
this repository. Keep changes aligned with these boundaries before adding new
logic.

## Responsibility Boundaries

- `src/memory/context/modules/*.py` builds compact model-facing context from
  runtime memory. It owns field names, compression, role labels, and the split
  between model-facing summaries and debug metadata.
- `src/agent/planning/prompts/*.txt` defines general planner and judge
  contracts. Prompts may describe how to use available evidence, but should not
  duplicate module internals or become a case-specific controller.
- `memory/FLYAGENT.md` is the shared Agent identity and general flight-knowledge
  baseline for both model planning and model semantic task parsing. Load it as
  its own model message instead of copying its guidance into parser prompts.
- `src/agent/semantic/prompts/task_parser_system.txt` owns the semantic-plan
  output schema, field meanings, and parsing contract. It must not duplicate
  general UAV identity, spatial reasoning, or flight knowledge from
  `memory/FLYAGENT.md`.
- `plugins/knowledge/*/SKILL.md` contains reusable domain knowledge. Skills must
  not depend on local context field names, debug schemas, benchmark cases, or
  project-private runtime details.
- `src/runtime/*` coordinates execution, observations, phase anchors, and debug
  artifacts. Runtime should not silently encode semantic task fixes that belong
  in context contracts, prompts, skills, validators, or future semantic update
  middleware.
- `evaluation/*` measures behavior and renders review/debug reports. Evaluation
  code may expose raw audit data for people, but benchmark-specific discoveries
  should become generic runtime/context/prompt improvements before affecting
  normal behavior.

## Benchmark Generalization Boundary

Benchmarks are diagnostic probes, not product specifications. A benchmark case
may reveal a weakness in the general UAV agent, but it must not directly decide
parser, planner, runtime, context, safety, skill, or prompt behavior.

Do not put benchmark case names, benchmark classes, reference paths, SR judge
results, nDTW scores, hidden truth, leaderboard heuristics, or test-set
experience into model-facing prompts, reusable skills, context contracts, or
runtime behavior. Evaluation-only facts must stay in `evaluation/*`, reports,
and human-facing debug artifacts.

Before changing normal behavior based on a benchmark result, restate the issue
as a general UAV capability gap. Examples include target-relative spatial
relations, around-target progress evidence, uncertainty-aware visual movement,
history summarization, or safe completion judgment. If a proposed change only
helps one benchmark and cannot be justified as a general user-facing UAV
capability, do not make it in the shared runtime, prompts, or knowledge base.

## Model-Facing vs Human-Facing Data

Model-facing context should be small, current, and decision useful:
- current instruction and semantic phase;
- current observation image;
- phase-start reference image when distinct;
- compact action or motion history summaries;
- a very small number of history-only examples;
- compact phase progress and completion evidence.

Human/debug/review data may be larger and more detailed:
- raw planner context and raw model outputs;
- full action logs and tool sequences;
- image paths, artifact refs, dimensions, and source metadata;
- safety internals, budgets, loop guards, and diagnostics;
- provenance notes explaining how model-facing summaries were built.

Do not move debug-only fields into model-facing context just because they are
useful for diagnosis. Convert them into compact, task-relevant summaries first.

## Prompt And Skill Writing Rules

Reusable skills are flight-domain knowledge, not runtime documentation. Do not
reference project-private fields such as `current_phase`, `phase_decision`,
`phase_progress_evidence`, `model_inputs`, debug metadata, report fields, or
benchmark artifacts from `plugins/knowledge/*/SKILL.md`. Phrase skill guidance
as general UAV behavior, visual reasoning, movement, route, safety, or
completion knowledge.

When two knowledge files describe one continuous reasoning chain, prefer one
primary skill plus optional references over multiple overlapping skills. For
example, visual target search, candidate confirmation, and target alignment
belong to one visual-target skill; detailed search patterns can live in that
skill's references and load only when selected.

Planner and parser prompts may reference the model contract they own, but they
should not reintroduce obsolete fields or teach reusable skills about internal
schemas. Keep old debug, evaluation, and report concepts out of model-facing
prompt examples unless that prompt explicitly owns the field.

Do not restore model-facing `direction` shorthand for movement. UAV movement
plans use numeric velocity arguments, and semantic direction should be expressed
through `relation` plus measurable metrics such as `forward_distance`,
`right_distance`, and `up_distance`.

Do not add prompt or skill warnings about data that should never be provided to
the model, such as hidden benchmark truth. Enforce that boundary in context and
evaluation plumbing instead of asking the model to ignore unavailable fields.

## Change Discipline

Before changing behavior, identify which layer owns the behavior. Do not put a
runtime/context field name into a reusable plugin. Do not put benchmark-specific
repairs into general planner prompts. Do not make SafetySupervisor solve semantic
or visual reasoning problems unless the issue is truly safety policy.

When replacing old behavior, clean the whole affected path:
- remove or update stale prompt text;
- update context schema descriptions;
- update plugin guidance that teaches the old behavior;
- update tests that preserve obsolete assumptions;
- check review/debug rendering so it shows the true model-facing context;
- document any compatibility path that must remain.

Every fix should report what changed, what old logic was removed or kept, how it
was tested, and what remains for later semantic update or image-memory work.
